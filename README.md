# OzFish.AI: An AI-Powered Mobile Application to Combat Illegal Fishing in NSW
**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

For my master's capstone, I led a six-member team in addressing a pertinent issue in Australia: illegal fishing. At times, recreational fishers, due to a lack of knowledge or resources, inadvertently catch fish that either belong to a protected species or don't meet size criteria. This not only harms the marine ecosystem but can also lead to potential fines. Although some mobile applications attempt to aid in fish identification, they often fall short in accuracy. Hence, we developed the OzFish.AI Android application. Through this app, users can easily snap a photo of their catch to instantly learn about its species and size, thus ensuring their fishing practices are compliant with regulations. Additionally, this project contributes a comprehensive dataset on New South Wales fish species for future studies, a highly accurate transfer-learning-based fish identification algorithm, and an Android application for aiding fishers in real time.

**ROLE**

I led a six-member team for my Master's Capstone Project. 

**APP FEATURES**

Our Android app, OzFish.AI, boasts three primary features:
1. **Fish Recognition (Fish.Identify)**:
	- By leveraging the phone's camera, users can identify any of the 68 fish species indigenous to NSW.
	- Using an embedded ML algorithm, the app then offers detailed information about the fish species, boasting an impressive top-5 accuracy rate of 90.22%.
2. **Fish Sizing (Fish.Measure)**:
	- With the integration of AR technology, users can ascertain the exact length of their catch.
	- This measurement can be combined with the Fish Recognition feature to give fishers insights like whether their catch meets the mandated size criteria.
3. **Fish Database Lookup (Fish.Search)**:
	- Users can delve into the app's database to retrieve comprehensive data about specific fish species.
	- Our database covers details on 74 fish species from NSW, including some subtypes of the 68 species pinpointed in the Fish.Identify feature.

**INCLUDED RESOURCES**

Contained within this repository are:
1. Detailed code documentation pertaining to the fish identification algorithm, inclusive of a README file.
2. Videos showcasing the mobile application in action.
